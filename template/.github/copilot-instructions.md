The backend part of this project uses Python. Please follow these conventions for the backend code:
- Use static typing with mypy annotations for all functions and variables.
- Write code with 4 spaces indentation (not tabs).
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions: snake_case for variables, functions, and methods; UPPER_CASE for constants; PascalCase for classes.
- Add docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules without any args, returns or examples.
